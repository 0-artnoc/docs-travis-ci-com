Travis CI is a hosted continuous integration service for the open source community. It is integrated with GitHub and offers first class support for:

* [Clojure](/docs/user/languages/clojure)
* [Erlang](/docs/user/languages/erlang)
* [Groovy](/docs/user/languages/groovy)
* [Java](/docs/user/languages/java)
* [JavaScript (with Node.js)](/docs/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs)
* [Perl](/docs/user/languages/perl)
* [PHP](/docs/user/languages/php)
* [Python](/docs/user/languages/python)
* [Ruby](/docs/user/languages/ruby)
* [Scala](/docs/user/languages/scala)

Our CI environment provides multiple runtimes (e.g. Node.js or PHP versions), data stores and so on. Because of this, hosting your project on travis-ci.org means you can effortlessly test your library or applications against multiple runtimes and data stores without even having all of them installed locally.

travis-ci.org originally started as a service for the Ruby community in early 2011 but has added support for many other technologies since then.

[Get started](/docs/user/getting-started/), it only takes a few minutes to get your project up and running on travis!

## Travis is open source

Services and libraries that make travis-ci.org work are [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/travis-ci).
