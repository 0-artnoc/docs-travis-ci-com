[just notes, not a public page]

The Travis "Love" crowdfunding campaign in 2012 was a fantastic success.
We were already amazed by the fantastic amount of support and great feedback
that we were getting while we were putting the campaign together. But when the
site went live in February and raised an incredible amount of money in no time
we were just blown away and plain humbled.

Over the last year we've been able to deliver all of the campaign goals,
including building Travis Pro as a service for running your private builds
on the same great platform.

## Good bye, Love Campaign 2012, it's been a blast!

So, with all of this done the Travis Love campaign has come to an end. Today
Travis CI is the stable, fantastic service that we all wanted it to be. Travis
CI GmbH is able to pay our bills so we can continue to improve the service as
our day job.

This campaign has achieved all of the goals, so it's time to say good bye.

Again, we'd like to say a huge thank you to all of you for your great support,
for your private donations and company sponsorships!

## Hello, Love Campaign 2013!

But we also know how many of you still want to show your appreciation for
Travis CI as a free open source service. Private donations are still coming in
and companies are still asking how they can help through sponsorships.

Thus, we are going to revamp the campaign.

This time, with a new direction. And a twist: The new campaign won't be about
Travis CI itself. It will be about our fantastic community.

For this we are creating Travis Foundation, a non-profit organization, that
will receive all of the funding coming in from the next-generation crowdfunding
campaign. Additionally Travis CI GmbH will donate a significant part of profits
made off Travis Pro to Travis Foundation on a regular basis.

Travis Foundation will use that money in order to:

* help make the Open Source community an even greater place
* support external projects that help newcomers get started, foster diversity
  and generall improve our culture
* foster the Travis CI community and improve the Travis CI codebase itself by
  providing opportunities to get started with such a relevant and high-profile
  open source project (such as part of OSS internships)

Some of the projects we are planning to support:

* RailsGirls Summer of Code
* Diversity in Tech
* Open Source internships

Out of these we currently focus on RailsGirls Summer of Code because of its
tight timeline.

## Looking for your help!

We are currently in the process of re-designing the Travis Love campaign.
Obviously we want to make the next-generation campaign as much fun as the
previous one was.

Thus, we are looking for your help.

Last year the community contributed fun perks and goodies like sticker designs
(thank you, Stickermule!), materials for ringtones (hahaha), design ideas for
the crowdfunding page and even remote pairing hours.

If you have any ideas for fun stuff, goodies or great perks then please drop
us a line!

This can be anything around arts, music, downloadable things, creative, fun,
crazy stuff, ... whatever comes to your mind, we'd love to get your input
for a brainstorm or even get you on board making stuff happen.

Get your name associated with lots of love, smiles and happiness floating
around the Travis Love campaign 2013 :)
