The [RailsGirls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlsberlin.github.io/summer-of-code/)
initiative, run by [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com), helps Rails Girls
students to get into Open Source projects and culture.

Just like in Google Summer of Code and Ruby Summer of Code, students will be
paid so they're free to work on Open Source projects for a few months. Unlike
those programs, the Rails Girls Summer of Code is about helping students to
expand their knowledge and skills by contributing to a Open Source project
(rather than producing highly sophisticated code).

Travis Foundation supports this initiative by donating money as part of the
[Travis Love Campaign](https://love.travis-ci.org), taking care of money
transfers and helping with organization.
