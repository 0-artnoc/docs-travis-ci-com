[promotional page about why Travis CI rocks]

Travis CI has run [how many] tests for [how many] open-source projects to date,
including Ruby, Rails, Rubinius, Rubygems, Bundler, Leiningen, Parrot, Symfony, [...]

If you use any of these you benefit from Travis CI.

Please donate so we can help make the Open Source community an even better place!


Travis CI started out in 2011 with the vision of providing free continuous
integration for open source projects as a service provided by the Open Source
community itself. We wanted to be for builds what Rubygems is for package
distribution.

Travis CI took the Open Source community's hearts by storm.

    What Github did for sharing code, Travis CI will do for testing code. The
    value of this service cannot be overstated. Travis CI is a paradigm shift. The
    world will be a better place when every open-source developer is running their
    test suite on Travis CI. â€” @brixen, Brian Ford, Rubinius
