[draft for a blog post]

Travis CI has always been deeply rooted in the Open Source community. The
source code itself is open source. We've always been active in the Open Source,
especially the Ruby community. And Travis CI has started out targetting open
source projects only, being crowdfunded by the community itself as well as
companies just as dedicated.

In late 2011 we started thinking about doing a crowdfunding campaign. People
wanted us to provide Travis CI as a product they could pay for in order to run
their private code on just the same platform as they were happy to run their
open source code. We ourselves had been working on Travis CI off our personal
bank accounts and we wanted to make sure we could continue working on this
on a daily basis.

So we founded a company, Travis CI GmbH, and started our crowdfunding "love"
campaign, with "private build support" being the top goal. The crowdfunding
campaign was a raging success. We've managed to meet all of the campaign goals
and travis-ci.org, while still growing like crazy, has now grown up in terms
of architecture and stability. Our customers on Travis Pro, whilst still in
closed beta, are happy and we are able to pay our bills and support continued
development of travis-ci.org off that.

Yet, over the last year or so our focus has shifted, slightly, almost
unnoticeable, even for ourselves. While we're still working on the open source
code that is the Travis CI codebase, and we're still active involved in the
community, ... we've been focussing on building a commercial product, and this
focus became more and more central over the last months.

With Travis Foundation we want to rectify that trend. Travis Foundation is
supposed to send a strong message about our involvement with non-commercial,
social, cultural engagement for the greater good.

Travis Foundation is a non-profit organization that aims at the following
goals:

* helping to make the Open Source community an even greater place
* support external projects that help newcomers get started, foster diversity
  and generall improve our culture
* foster the Travis CI community and improve the Travis CI codebase itself by
  providing opportunities to get started with such a relevant and high-profile
  open source project (such as part of OSS internships)

Some of the projects we are planning to support:

* RailsGirls Summer of Code
* Diversity in Tech
* Open Source internships

Out of these we currently focus on RailsGirls Summer of Code because of its
tight timeline.

In order to make all of this happen Anika Lindtner will join our team starting
[...].

Travis Foundation will be funded by taking over and redesigning the Travis
crowdfunding "love" campaign. Additionally Travis CI GmbH will donate a
significant part of profits made off Travis Pro to Travis Foundation on a
regular basis.
