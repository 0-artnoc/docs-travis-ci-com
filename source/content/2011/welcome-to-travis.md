Travis CI is an open-source, distributed build system for the open source community.

We are going to blog more about it later but for now you can read up on the *initial ideas* on <a href="http://svenfuchs.com/2011/2/5/travis-a-distributed-build-server-tool-for-the-ruby-community">Sven's blog</a> and flip through <a href="http://talk-2011-lyon.heroku.com">a presentation</a> that we gave at 3 conferences and 2 Ruby user groups this summer.

If you feel like this is a great project then jump into <a href="irc://travis#irc.freenode.net">#travis on irc.freenode.net</a> and say hi!
