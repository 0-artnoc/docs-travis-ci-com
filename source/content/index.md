## What is Travis CI

Travis CI is a distributed continuous integration for the open source community. It is integrated with GitHub and offers first class support for
multiple technologies

 * Clojure
 * Erlang
 * Node.js
 * PHP
 * Ruby

and more. Our CI environment provides multiple runtimes (e.g. Node.js or PHP versions), data stores and so on. Because of this,
hosting your project on travis-ci.org means you can effortlessly test your library or applications against multiple runtimes and
data stores without even having all of them installed locally.

travis-ci.org originally started as a service for the Ruby community in early 2011 but has added support for many other technologies since
then.

<a href="/docs/user/getting-started/">Get started</a>, it only takes a few minutes to get your project up and running on travis!


## Travis is open source

Services and libraries that make travis-ci.org work are [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/travis-ci).
