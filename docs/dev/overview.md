### What This Guide Covers

This guide explains what applications, libraries, tools and practices make travis-ci.org run. It briefly outlines why each part of the system works the way it does and what upsides and downsides it entails. It intentionally leaves out many details and should be considered a high level overview.

Please note that **this guide is not yet complete** (started on Jan 11th, 2012). We will expand it.

## Applications

Travis CI v3 (deployed in November 2011) consists of 4 key applications:

* [Travis Hub](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-hub)
* [Travis Server](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci)
* [Travis Worker](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-worker)
* [Travis Listener](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-listener)
* [Travis Boxes](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-boxes)

that communicate primarily over [AMQP 0.9.1](http://rubyamqp.info/articles/amqp_9_1_model_explained/). Some of them also share our main database but in a way that isolates updates from read requests.

### One Day in Life of Build Request

#### Early Morning

When external `Build Request` (currently, push notification from GitHub) comes in via HTTP, it is handled by `Travis Server`. If there is no existing builds history for the project, it is initialized. `Travis Server` then emits a `configuration task` message and is done with its part.

`Configuration task` message is routed by RabbitMQ to a queue used by `Travis Hub`. The Hub fetches `.travis.yml` from project repository, parses it and checks whether the build has to be skipped. If so, the message is not processed further. If not, then it publishes one or more `build task` messages, one per `build matrix` row.

#### Noon

`Build task` messages are routed to one of several queues (depending on project language setting in `.travis.yml`) and consumed by one of `Travis Workers`. `Travis Worker` that consumed the message then uses information in it to determine how to run the build. Then it establishes SSH connection to one of snapshotted `Travis VMs`, picks a `technology-specific builder` and runs the build. Build lifecycle is documented in detail in our [Build Configuration guide](/docs/user/build-configuration/).

Commands that `technology-specific builder` runs over SSH produce output (via standard in and standard out streams) that `Travis Worker` captures and publishes as `build log chunk` messages. Those messages are routed by RabbitMQ to one of several queues: Ruby/common, JVM languages, Node.js, PHP, etc). From there, they are pushed to consumers in `Travis Hub` which **primary purpose is to collect build logs and process them**.

Build log processing in `Travis Hub` has multiple steps, some of which have strict ordering requirements and some are executed asynchronously in separate threads:

* Update build log in the database
* Propagate `build log chunk` messages to Web browsers using WebSockets
* Detect build termination
* On build termination: update build task records, deliver email/IRC/Campfire notifications
* Proactively archive build logs

This is where our single page rich client app that `Travis Server` serves comes in. It receives propagated event messages via WebSockets and updates the UI in near real time.

#### Night

When the build is done (successfully or not), apps prepare to sleep:

 * `Travis Hub` finalizes build tasks state, propagates `build termination event` messages to Web browsers, delivers notifications if needed.
 * `Travis Worker` powers off and rolls back the VM it had been using to run this build. This wipes any changes to the CI environment so no state is preserved between builds.

The End. The system is ready for another build request.

## Travis Server

`Travis Server` is the main front-end application. It currently performs several related functions:

* Serves Ember.js-powered frontend application that you can see in action on [travis-ci.org](http://travis-ci.org)
* Serves API requests (build statuses, build status badges, CI tray requests and more)

## Travis Listener

`Travis Listener` is a small Sinatra application. Currently its main purpose is to accept incoming `build requests`.

## Travis Worker

`Travis Worker` runs builds using snapshotted `Travis VMs`, captures build output and streams it to `Travis Hub` next to other build lifecycle messages. The build mechanism is provided by `[travis-build](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build)` library.

Each instance of `Travis Worker` can drive multiple `Travis VMs`, one VM per worker thread. travis-ci.org is powered by several (currently 9) `Travis Worker` app instances, varying from 3 to 6 VMs per machine.

Adding support for new technologies primarily involves `Travis Build` library updates (more on that in the Libraries section below) as well as `Travis CI Environment` updates (also below).

## Travis Hub

`Travis Hub` collects build lifecycle events (for example, `build log chunks`) and processes them. Processing includes but is not limited to

* Updates to build log in the database
* Propagating build events to Web browsers using WebSockets
* Delivering notifications (email, IRC, etc)
* Build archival

Compared to Travis CI applications, `Travis Hub` has higher performance, concurrency and GC predictability requirements. This was key motivation to making `Travis Hub` JVM-based (currently we use JRuby).

`Travis Hub` consumes messages from multiple reporting queues, one per technology we support (reporting messages from Ruby builds are thus completely separated from the Erlang ones, for example), and concurrently processes them.

It is fair to say that `Travis Hub` is the most complex of all Travis CI applications we have today. This is why we carefully evaluate what features are worth adding to the Hub: many features simply won't be worth the complexity.

## Travis Boxes

`Travis Boxes` is a small set of tools we use to provision and build `Travis VM images` (see below). It currently builds Vagrant boxes (.ovf images + some metadata used by [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)) but will be extended to build images in other formats in the future.

## Libraries

Travis CI applications sometimes have to share certain piece of code. For example, `Travis Hub` and `Travis Server` need to agree on the database schema. Because of that and to structure our code better, we extracted and/or developed a number of Travis CI libraries:

* [travis-core](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-core) hosts most of our domain models
* [travis-build](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build) encapsulates build lifecycle `Travis Workers` use and provides a unified API for language-specific builders
* [travis-support](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-support) contains various support classes and utilities. Used by `Travis Hub`, `Travis Server`, `Travis Listener` and `Travis Worker`.

In addition, there are mutliple side projects we developed as part of working on Travis CI, for example

* [simple_states](https://github.com/svenfuchs/simple_states)
* [hashr](https://github.com/svenfuchs/hashr)
* [sous chef](https://github.com/michaelklishin/sous-chef)

as well as projects we rely on heavily and contribute to, like

* [hot bunnies](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/hot_bunnies)
* [amqp gem](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp)

## CI Environment

`Travis CI Environment` refers to the environment (tools, services, libraries, environment settings, etc) inside `Travis VMs` that `Travis Workers` use to run builds. The environment is snapshotted (no state is left between builds).

Part of the appeal of Travis CI is that [common services and tools](/docs/user/ci-environment) (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, MongoDB, Riak and many more) are preinstalled and available for projects to use. We also provide passwordless sudo to make it possible to test projects with unique requirements and avoid having to install and maintain all the software known to mankind.

`Travis CI Environment` is provisioned using modern automation tools and distirbuted in the form of `Travis VM images`.

## VM images

`Travis VMs` are created from `Travis VM images`. There is one image per technology we support, for example, Node.js or Erlang. Because Travis CI has its roots in the Ruby community, Ruby VMs are referred to as `common VMs` and also host Clojure, Java and even Lua projects. We will spin off new image types, for example, for JVM languages, as we improve support for them (for example, move to provide multiple JDK versions to test against).

`Travis VM images` are built using [travis-boxes](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-boxes), a set of tools based on [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com), [Veewee](https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee) and [OpsCode Chef](http://opscode.com/chef).

Chef cookbooks (`[travis-cookbooks](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-cookbooks)`) are used to install software on `Travis VMs`.

## CI Environment Upgrade Process

To update software in the `CI environment`, we periodically rebuild `Travis VM images` and deploy them. Although this process is highly automated, there is certain amount of testing involved and it takes time to build, upload and download `Travis VM images` that range from 1.6 to 2.5 GB in size. This means that CI environment upgrades happen roughly once a week for
each worker type.

## Buzzwords Listâ„¢

Travis CI currently uses

* [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org) 9.0+ as its main data store
* [RabbitMQ](http://rabbitmq.com) 2.5+ for messaging
* [JRuby](http://jruby.org) for `Travis Worker` with the official VirtualBox Java client.
* JRuby for `Travis Hub` with [Hot Bunnies](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/hot_bunnies) and the official RabbitMQ Java client.
* CRuby 1.9.2 on [Heroku](http://heroku.com) for `Travis Server`
* [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) (formerly known as SproutCore 2) for the rich `Travis Server` UI frontend
* [Pusher](http://pusher.com) for delivering messages to Web browsers over WebSockets
* [OpsCode Chef](http://opscode.com/chef), [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and [Veewee](https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee) for `CI environment` provisioning & managing VM images.
* CouchDB for build log archiving

This technology stack has changed significantly over our first year in operation and will change in the future should the need arise.

## Worker Machines

Worker machines travis-ci.org uses are donated by the community and our sponsors ([drop us a line](mailto:contact@travis-ci.org) if you are interested in donating hardware or otherwise sponsoring the project). `Travis Workers` run alongside `Travis VMs` they use, one worker thread per virtual machine. The `Travis Worker` implementation currently depends on VirtualBox for virtualization, although the dependency will be abstracted away in the future.

Application instances that power travis-ci.org are primarily hosted in two locations: on the West Coast of the US and in Germany.
