title: "Travis CI Single Platform"
---

On May 2nd, 2018 Travis CI integration open source and private projects onto a unified platform on **travis-ci.com**!

This means you can manage public and private repositories from one domain, allow open source projects the ability to add extra concurrency, and allow our team to maintain and improve a single CI platform.

We are implementing these changes with GitHub Apps, which not only provides a richer integration with GitHub, but also allows for many amazing features we plan to roll out in the next few months.

## What This Means To You


<!--  We should create a basic doc on our docs site which is mostly similar to a saved reply. It could/should explain that migration options will be available soon, you can auto opt into migration by setting up your open source repos on .com and we will email you when migration is available, or if you want to migrate now without retaining your build history, contact support? -->


### If you're new to Travis CI

If you are new to Travis CI, you can sign up at [travis-ci.com](https://www.travis-ci.com) for both open source and private repo testing. You will only need to provide your billing details if you want additional concurrency beyond our free open source support, or if you upgrade to a subscription after your 100-free-private-builds trial.

### If you’re currently using travis-ci.org

Travis CI will continue to support open source development as we've done in the past.  

If you're an open source developer currently testing your project with Travis CI, your builds will continue to run on travis-ci.org for the moment. We will announce more soon on how to migrate your build history from travis-ci.org to travis-ci.com, but for now your currently active repositories will remain on the .org platform and you won’t notice any change at all.

If you are activating a new repository on Travis CI, please use [travis-ci.com](https://www.travis-ci.com).

#### Migrating to travis-ci.coming

Sometime in May 2018 we'll be migrating repositories from travis-ci.org to travis-ci.coming

You can opt in to migration by manually switching your repositories to travis-ci.com now (we'll email you before the migration happens), or if you don't need to keep your build history and want to switch right now please reach out to [support@travis-ci.com](mailto:support@travis-ci.com?Subject=Hello%20Travis%20CI).

### If you’re already using travis-ci.com

There will be no changes to your private repositories and you can continue to build and test your private projects as you do right now.

Your public repositories that are active and building will remain on travis-ci.org for the moment. You will be able to add new public repositories to travis-ci.com. In the coming months, we will provide an option for migrating your active open source projects to travis-ci.com.

If you have any questions, please reach out to [support@travis-ci.com](mailto:support@travis-ci.com?Subject=Hello%20Travis%20CI)
