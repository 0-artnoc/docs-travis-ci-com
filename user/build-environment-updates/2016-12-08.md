## 2016-12-08

### Schedule

[2016-12-08  UTC](http://everytimezone.com/#2016-12-6,180,cn3)


### Details

[CVE-2016-8655](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8655) was announced and contains a potential _root escalation vulnerability_. We are proactively updating the kernel version to a fixed kernel to ensure that any potential risk is minimized for our users.

This update applies to container-based Ubuntu Trusty and Precise Docker host environment, and is considered a bugfix update, since it's only changing the kernel version that the Docker containers run inside.

### Fixed

- Updated kernel version of `4.8.7` to `4.8.12`
