Travis Foundation is here to help making the world of Open Source an even better place.

Travis Foundation is a non-profit organization with the objective of improving
Travis CI OSS as an open source platform and fostering the community around
Travis CI as well as the open source community in general.

This includes supporting secondary and external projects that provide
opportunities and chances to newcomers, foster diversity and make the community
an even greater place in general.

All money made by the [Travis Love Campaign](https://love.travis-ci.org) is
going to Travis Foundation. Also Travis CI GmbH will give a good part of the
profit it is making off [Travis Pro](http://travis-ci.com) back to the
community.

## Current Projects

### RailsGirls Summer of Code

Rails Girls Summer of Code helps Rails Girls students get into Open Source.

Just like in Google Summer of Code and Ruby Summer of Code, students will be
paid so they're free to work on Open Source projects for a few months. Unlike
those programs, the Rails Girls Summer of Code is about helping students to
further expand their knowledge and skills by contributing to a great Open
Source project (rather than producing highly sophisticated code).
